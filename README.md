[ChatGPT conversation saving bookmark](https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt)

It's started as [DEV.to article](https://dev.to/jcubic/save-chatgpt-as-html-file-dhh).
But I've decided that It would be better to track it on GitHub and update so it will still work,
when OpenAI change their web application.

## What is Bookmarklet?
Bookmarklet is a JavaScript code that run as URL from your bookmarks. To run the code you need to
create new Bookmark and copy the code from the
[bookmark.js](https://github.com/jcubic/chat-gpt/blob/master/bookmark.js) JavaScript file. If you
don't know how you can open the [website](https://jcubic.github.io/chat-gpt/) and drag & drop the
link to your bookmarks.

You can read more about [Bookmarklets on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet).

## Interesting projects
The main reason for this project is to allow saving the chatGPT conversation as files on the disk.
Here is interesting usage of the bookmark that people made:

## Contribution
If you want to add something to the bookmark, please do. Also, if the code doesn't work don't
hesitate to report an issue.

If you change the bookmark in some way, fix a bug or add a feature. Make sure to run the bookmark,
download the file and add it to the repository in current date folder. You should also link to that
file in index.html. This is to show how the updates works, it also act as a CHANGELOG.
